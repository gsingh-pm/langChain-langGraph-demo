    "### LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs excel at responding to prompts in a general context, but struggle in a specific domain they were never trained on. For example, an LLM can provide a python code to sync data from DB to CRM. However, it can't tell you how the CRM sync works at policyme.\n",
    "To do that, we must integrate the LLM with the organization’s internal data sources like confluence docs and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is an open source FRAMEWORK for building applications based on large language models (LLMs) to solve exactly these gaps by streamling intermediate steps to develop such data-responsive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the customization, accuracy, and relevancy of the information the models generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langchain is designed to develop diverse applications powered by language models more effortlessly, including chatbots, question-answering, content generation, summarizers, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits -\n",
    "- With LangChain, organizations can repurpose LLMs for domain-specific applications without retraining or fine-tuning.\n",
    "- LangChain simplifies artificial intelligence (AI) development by abstracting the complexity of data source integrations and prompt refining.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "On of the most common use case of langchain is to build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications like it was demoed by Joseph. If you hope back to the code he shared he was using langchain to create his RAG application. So, I'll try to continue with the similar RAG application to explain various components of a langchain.\n",

Since these endpoints are\\ncurrently accessible without any form of identity validation, it introduces a security gap.\\nThus, without having a mechanism to enforce identity or restrict data access before\\nauthentication, our early-stage flows remain vulnerable to misuse.\\nSolution -\\nTo address this, we introduced a new JWT token type: PRE_AUTH, which will serve as a\\ntemporary token for users who have not yet verified their email (via magic link) but have already\\nstarted interacting with our APIs.\\nKey steps in the solution:\\nAs early as possible in the flow (right before /household_infos), we trigger a call to \\n/users to:\\nCreate a user with a dummy email,\\nIssue a PRE_AUTH token embedded in a user_jwt_token_pri cookie.\\nAll endpoints that modify or access data pre-authentication will now require this \\nPRE_AUTH token via a new decorator verify_pre_auth_token.\\nThe decorator allows access to all other token types (ensuring the same endpoints are\\ncompatible with both authenticated and unauthenticated users).\\nThis allows us to:\\nRestrict users to only read/write their own records, even before email verification.\\nEliminate unrestricted, public access to sensitive API functionality.\\nOnce the user verifies their email, the dummy account is either:\\nUpgraded (if the email is new) by updating the dummy email to the real one, or\\nMerged (if the email already exists) by transferring ownership of related records to the\\nexisting account.'),\n",
